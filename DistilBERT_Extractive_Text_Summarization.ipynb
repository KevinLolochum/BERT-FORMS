This funding is part of the province's COVID-19 fall preparedness plan, Keeping Ontarians Safe: Preparing for Future Waves of COVID-19, which will enable the province to respond to future surges and waves of the virus, while preserving hospital capacity.\n",

This program provides integrated, team-based care where multiple types of services are wrapped around the patient. This can include up to 11 hours a day of personal support services and nursing services per patient. Other community services may include Meals on Wheels, homemaking and transportation to medical appointments.\n",

Ontario has seen a significant increase in the number of visits provided virtually across Ontario. This investment will equip health care providers with the support needed to sustain current capacity and improve the quality of care delivered virtually. Virtual care in home and community care settings will also benefit rural and remote area regions where access to care is more challenging.\n",

This will support the delivery of remote patient care, monitoring and symptom management at home to support COVID-19 patients and other vulnerable populations. The implementation of these remote patient monitoring programs will allow patients to connect virtually with a health care provider for routine checkups, symptom monitoring, referral to other providers, and escalation where necessary to a virtual or in-person medical assessment.\n",
        "\n",
        "As part of this funding, $5 million will be invested in virtual home and community care capacity by providing funding directly to frontline home and community care service providers. This investment will help purchase technologies for video conferencing, remote monitoring and secure messaging that will enable care to continue to be delivered at home, minimizing face-to-face visits where appropriate, and keeping clients and families out of the hospital.\n",

        "The government continues to build a better, more connected healthcare system through the creation of Ontario Health Teams, which are bringing together health care providers to work as one team to improve patient outcomes. Through an Ontario Health Team, patients will experience easier transitions from one provider to another, including, for example, between hospitals and home care providers, with one patient story, one patient record and one care plan. Patients and families will also have access to 24/7 navigation and care coordination services. Forty-two Ontario Health Teams have been approved to date.'''"
