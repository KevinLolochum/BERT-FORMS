        "-  Instead of using pretraining on the pretraining on MLM and NSP, RoBERTA does **not** use **NSP** and use **dynamic masking** instead of  static masking used in BERT\n",

        "- **RoBERTa** uses **larger batches and data** during pretraining hence less steps and longer trianing time compared to **BERT** but comparable to after BERT models like **XLNet**\n",
        "- Longer sentence sequences where also used compared to those used in BERT that are truncated at 512 tokens. (i.e full-sentence)\n",
        "- It also uses byte-pair encoding **(BPE)** which uses subwords to create embeddings and therefore reducing the vocabulary size that is normally huge in large corpora.\n",
